# Random-Password-Generator

A very simple python script used to make one or more random and unique passwords for use anywhere.

All passwords are made up of letters both uppsercase and lowercase as well as digits and special characters.

The total number of possible passwords of length n is 94^n making it incresingly secure as the length increases. 

Unlike human-made passwords, the order of characters is truly random such that digits and special characters appear in unpredictable places.
